# Privacy Policy for [ChatBot](https://chatbot-b3b.pages.dev/)

**Effective Date:** [December 6 2025]

## 1. Introduction

We (the developer of [ChatBot](https://chatbot-b3b.pages.dev/)) respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes how ChatBot handles data when you use the app, and what choices you have in relation to that data.

## 2. What Data We Collect

### 2.1 Local Data

* [ChatBot](https://chatbot-b3b.pages.dev/) stores user data such as notes, files, documents, and any content you create with the app stays locally on your device only.
* We **do not** send your notes, documents, or personal files to any remote server.
* We do **not** collect or store personal identifiers (like name, email, phone number), unless you explicitly add such information yourself inside a note or file — in which case that data stays on your device.

### 2.2 Permissions & Device Data

* [ChatBot](https://chatbot-b3b.pages.dev/) requests only the minimal permissions necessary (e.g. storage access) for functionality like reading/writing files or restoring backups.
* The app does **not** collect any additional device or usage data (no analytics, no logging, no telemetry).

## 3. Data Storage & Security

* All data created or imported via ChatBot is stored locally on your device in a private app storage (or as files you manage).
* [ChatBot](https://chatbot-b3b.pages.dev/) does **not** share, upload, or transmit your data to any server, third‑party service, or cloud unless you yourself explicitly export or share a file.
* If you uninstall the app or delete content from within the app, that data is removed from your device (to the extent supported by the operating system).

## 4. Third‑Party Services & SDKs

* [ChatBot](https://chatbot-b3b.pages.dev/) does **not** integrate third‑party analytics, ad services, or remote SDKs that collect user data.
* There are no built‑in trackers, ads, or external services by default.

## 5. Children’s Privacy

* [ChatBot](https://chatbot-b3b.pages.dev/) does not knowingly collect personal data from children under age 13.
* Because the app does not collect personal identifiers or send data externally, it is generally safe for use by users of any age but parental supervision is advised when children use devices.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally (if we add new features requiring additional permissions). When we make changes, we will revise the “Effective Date” at the top. Users are encouraged to review the policy periodically.
