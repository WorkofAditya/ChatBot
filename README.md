# Chatbot 

**Chatbot** is a secure, privacy-focused web app that works entirely offline.  
It lets you chat with your personal vault to quickly find, store, and manage important documents, notes, and files, all safely saved in your browser using IndexedDB.

## Features
- Smart chatbot interface for searching your saved data  
- Store text, images, and PDFs securely offline  
- Local data storage (nothing leaves your device)  
- Import & export vault backups

## How It Works
All data is stored locally in your browser via IndexedDB and never sent to any server.  
You can safely use it offline to manage sensitive information.

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- IndexedDB (for secure offline storage)  
- PWA (Progressive Web App) support
